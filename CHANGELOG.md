* Fixed some missing translations.
* [CMBT]: Fixed Piper's Slime ammo damage (increased from 5 to 10).

## Major Release 3.0.0 Highlights <sup><sup>[🔼 Back to top](#margo-changelogs)</sup></sup>

* Re-unification of all the combat-oriented modules: CMBT, WPNZ, SLNGS, RNGS and ENCH are now collectively known as CMBT.
    * Several redundant config settings (like those related to Auto-Selection) were consolidated.
    * Only the Glowstone Ring features from RNGS were moved to TWX instead.
* Changed several translation keys for better formatting with Pathoschild's Translation Generator. This may lead to missing translation issues, so please report if you see any.
* [CMBT]: Improvements to the Blade of Ruin questline. See the [CMBT changelog](Modules/Combat/CHANGELOG.md#3_0_0).
* [CMBT]: Blade of Dawn now also deals extra damage to shadow and undead monsters and grants a small light while held.
* [CMBT]: Blade of Dawn and Infinity weapon beams no longer cast a shadow.
* [CMBT]: Prismatic Shard ammo is no longer affected by Preserving Enchantment. That combination was broken AF.

* [TWX]: Re-organized config settings by skill.
