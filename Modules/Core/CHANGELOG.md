    - **Bleeding:** Causes damage every second. Damage increases exponentially with each additional stack. Stacks up to 5x. Does not affect Ghosts, Skeletons, Golems, Dolls or Mechanical enemies (ex. Dwarven Sentry).
    - **Burning:** Causes damage equal to 1/16th of max health every 3s for 15s, and reduces attack by half. Does not affect fire enemies (i.e., Lava Lurks, Magma Sprites and Magama Sparkers).
    - **Chilled:** Reduces movement speed by half for 5s. If Chilled is inflicted again during this time, then causes Freeze.
    - **Freeze:** Cannot move or attack for 30s. The next hit during the duration deals double damage and ends the effect.
    - **Poisoned:** Causes damage equal to 1/16 of max health every 3s for 15s, stacking up to 3x.
    - **Slowed:** Reduces movement speed by half for the duration.
